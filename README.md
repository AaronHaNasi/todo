# TODO app by Aaron Bager

This app was developed at the request of Rutherford during their interview process per the prompt:

```Build a TODO app that can store/edit/delete TODOs. Use Firebase as your datastore (Cloud Fire Store preferred). Extra credit for setting up a login screen and setting up authentication. For the front end you can use Flutter or React. If React and Flutter aren't in your wheel house, you can let us know the frameworks you would like to use and we will evaluate it on a case by case basis. Please Store the code in a public or private Github repository that you can share with us.```

I chose the following frameworks:

## Python
I chose python as it is one of my preferred languages. It is easy to read compared to a lot of languages, which I think makes it very valuable for technical skills tests.
